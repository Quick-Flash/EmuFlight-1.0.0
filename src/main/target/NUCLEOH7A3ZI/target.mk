# Top level Makefile adds, if not defined, HSE_VALUE, as default for F4 targets.
# We don't want to assume any particular value until de facto design is established,
# so we set the value here.
#
# However, HSE_VALUE is currently a global build option and can not be changed from
# board to board. Generic target will have to store this value as a PG variable and
# change clock on the fly after the PG became readable.

HSE_VALUE    = 8000000 # For NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q with STLINK, HSE is 8MHz from STLINK
